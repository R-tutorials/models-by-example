[![Lifecycle Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-stable-green.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/)

This is the repo for the document found [here](https://m-clark.github.io/models-by-example/), based on the raw code repo- [Miscellaneous R Code](https://github.com/m-clark/Miscellaneous-R-Code/).  The document code has been tidied and may have other improvements relative to the original repo, but remains a conceptual/tutorial endeavor to various modeling  techniques and algorithms.
